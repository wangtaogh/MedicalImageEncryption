# Medical Image Encryption
MATLAB Implementation of the paper titled "[A Lightweight Chaosâ€‘Based Medical Image Encryption Scheme Using Random Shuffling and XOR Operations](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11277-021-08584-z.pdf)".
<br>This paper aims to propose a new algorithm based on Symmetric Key Cryptography that uses Henon Chaotic Maps, Brownian Motion, Chen Chaotic System and XOR Operations to encrypt medical images.

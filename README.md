# Medical Image Encryption
MATLAB Implementation of the paper titled "[A Lightweight Chaosâ€‘Based Medical Image Encryption Scheme Using Random Shuffling and XOR Operations](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11277-021-08584-z.pdf)".
<br>This paper aims to propose a new algorithm based on Symmetric Key Cryptography that uses Henon Chaotic Maps, Brownian Motion, Chen Chaotic System and XOR Operations to encrypt medical images.

## Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to your desired location and clone the repository ( Alternatively, Download the zip file and extract its contents ) 
```
git clone https://github.com/divyekalra1/MedicalImageEncryption.git 
```
### 2. Import the 'MedicalImageEncryption' folder into MATLAB. All the images in need of encryption have to be kept in the "Images" folder.

### 3. Run the cryptography_paper.m program
